Subject: [PATCH] Ignore errors from coverage tests (#138)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Now builds are failing because coverage combine doesn't work on
Rawhide. It would be nice to find why this is happening but this is not
a reason for build to fail.
